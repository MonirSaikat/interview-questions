### Interview Questions for MySQL: 
##### 0: How to get the current MySQL version?
To get the current MySQL version, you can use the following methods:

Command Line (Linux/Unix): Use the command `mysql --version`.
Command Line (Windows): Use the command `mysql -V`.
MySQL Client: Log in to the MySQL client and run the SQL query `SELECT VERSION();`
phpMyAdmin: The MySQL version is typically displayed on the initial page
MySQL Workbench: You can find the MySQL version in the "Server Status" section.

##### 1: What is the MySQL serverâ€™s default port?
The default port for MySQL server is 3306.

##### 2: How many different tables are present in MySQL?
The number of different tables in a MySQL database can vary widely and depends on the specific database schema and the data model used. There is no fixed or standard number of tables in MySQL. The number of tables is determined by the design and requirements of the database. Some databases may have just a few tables, while others can have many tables to represent different data entities and relationships.

##### 3: What is Difference between CHAR_LENGTH and LENGTH?
`CHAR_LENGTH` counts the number of characters, while `LENGTH` counts the number of bytes in a string.


##### 4: What do you understand by % and _ in the like statement?
`%` matches any sequence of characters (including zero).
`_` matches any single character.

##### 5: How many index columns can be created in a table?
There's no strict limit; you can create multiple indexes on a table, but be cautious of performance implications.

##### 6: What are string types available for columns?
Common string types include VARCHAR, CHAR, TEXT, and ENUM.


##### 7: Explain the main difference between FLOAT and DOUBLE?
FLOAT is a single-precision floating-point number, while DOUBLE is a double-precision floating-point number. DOUBLE provides higher precision but uses more storage.

##### 8: Explain the difference between having and where clause in MySQL.
- `WHERE` filters rows before aggregation.
- `HAVING` filters results after aggregation.

##### 9: How can we add a column in MySQL?
Use the `ALTER TABLE` statement with the `ADD COLUMN` clause to add a new column to an existing table.

Use the `SELECT` statement with `LIMIT 10` to retrieve the top 10 rows from a table.


##### 13: What is the use of the â€˜DISTINCTâ€™ keyword in MySQL?
The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to retrieve unique values from a column in a table. It ensures that only distinct values are returned, eliminating duplicates.

##### 14: Which storage engines are used in MySQL?
Common storage engines in MySQL include InnoDB, MyISAM, and MEMORY. Each engine has unique features and is suitable for different use cases.

##### 15: How to create a table in MySQL?
Use the `CREATE TABLE` statement to define the table structure, specify column names and data types, and set constraints like primary keys and foreign keys.


##### 16: What types of relationships are used in MySQL?
Common types include one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships. These are established using keys like primary and foreign keys.


##### 17: How to insert Date in MySQL? 
You can insert a date into a MySQL table using the `INSERT` statement with a valid date format, like `YYYY-MM-DD`.


##### 18: What is join? Tell different join in MySQL.
A join is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. Common joins include INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN), RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN), and FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN).


##### 19: What is a primary key? How to drop the primary key in MySQL? 
A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table. To drop a primary key, use the `ALTER TABLE` statement with the `DROP PRIMARY KEY` clause.


##### 20: What is InnoDB?
InnoDB is a popular storage engine in MySQL known for its support of transactions, foreign keys, and ACID compliance. It's widely used for reliable and transaction-safe database operations.


##### 21: What is the difference between UNION and UNION ALL in MySQL?
- `UNION` removes duplicate rows.
- `UNION ALL` includes all rows, even duplicates

##### 22: What is a `timestamp` in MySQL?
A `timestamp` in MySQL is a data type used to store date and time values with a time zone.

You can create indexes using CREATE INDEX statements, by defining primary keys, or by using the ALTER TABLE statement. Common index types are B-tree, hash, and full-text indexes.


##### 31: What are a clustered index and a non clustered index?
In MySQL, the concept of a clustered index is mainly associated with the InnoDB storage engine. A clustered index determines the physical order of rows in a table and is typically based on the primary key. A non-clustered index doesn't affect the physical order of rows and is separate from the data.


##### 32: How to validate emails using a single query?
You can validate emails using regular expressions in a query. For example, `SELECT email FROM users WHERE email REGEXP '^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Za-z]{2,4}$'`;

You can add users in MySQL using the `CREATE USER` statement or through a client application. You need to specify their username and password.


##### 38: What are MySQL Triggers?
MySQL triggers are database objects that automatically execute actions (e.g., SQL statements) in response to specific events, such as INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations on a table.

##### 39: How many Triggers are possible in MySQL?
In MySQL, you can create multiple triggers for each table. The number of triggers you can create is not strictly limited, but it's good practice to keep them manageable for clarity and maintainability.

The logical architecture of MySQL includes components like the Query Optimizer, Storage Engines, and the SQL Layer. The Query Optimizer optimizes queries, the Storage Engines handle data storage and retrieval, and the SQL Layer manages SQL parsing and execution.


##### 43: What is Scaling in MySQL?
Scaling in MySQL refers to the process of increasing the capacity and performance of a MySQL database system to handle growing workloads and user demands. It can involve techniques like sharding, replication, and clustering to distribute and manage data across multiple servers.

##### 44: What is the purpose of the SHOW TABLES command in MySQL?
The SHOW TABLES command is used to list the tables in the current database.

##### 45: What is normalization and denormalization in the context of database design?
Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. Denormalization is the opposite, where data is intentionally duplicated to optimize query performance.


##### 46: What is the ACID properties in the context of database transactions?
ACID stands for `Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability`. These properties ensure that database transactions are reliable, and data remains consistent even in the face of errors.

##### 47: How can you prevent SQL injection in MySQL?
To prevent SQL injection, use parameterized queries or prepared statements. These techniques ensure that user inputs are treated as data and not executable SQL code.


##### 48: What is the difference between a LEFT JOIN and a RIGHT JOIN in MySQL?
A LEFT JOIN retrieves all records from the left table and matching records from the right table, while a RIGHT JOIN retrieves all records from the right table and matching records from the left table.


##### 49: What is a stored procedure in MySQL?
A stored procedure is a set of SQL statements that can be executed as a single unit. It is stored in the database and can be called multiple times with different parameters.

##### 50: How do you export data from a MySQL table to a CSV file?
You can export data to a CSV file using the `SELECT...INTO OUTFILE` statement or by using MySQL client utilities like `mysqldump` with the `--tab` option.

In Laravel, soft deletes are implemented by adding the `use SoftDeletes` trait to your Eloquent model and defining the `deleted_at` column in the corresponding database table. Soft deleted records are not removed from the database but marked as deleted by setting the `deleted_at` timestamp. You can use the withTrashed and onlyTrashed methods to retrieve soft deleted records.


##### 53: How do you generate migrations?
You can generate a migration in Laravel using the artisan command `php artisan make:migration`. For example: `php artisan make:migration create_table_name`. This will create a new migration file in the `database/migrations` directory, where you can define the schema for your database table.


##### 54: How do you mock a static facade methods?
To mock a static facade method in Laravel for testing, you can use a package like Mockery or PHPUnit. You can create a mock object of the facade and define the expected behavior using these tools. Example:
